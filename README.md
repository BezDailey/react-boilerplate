# React Boilerplate

This repository serves as a boilerplate for React projects, providing a clean and scalable starting point using modern tools and best practices. It is designed with Vite for fast development, Tailwind CSS for styling, React Router for client-side routing, and Radix UI for accessible, headless component primitives.

## Features

- **Vites:** A fast and modern build tool for React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router:** A robust solution for handling client-side routing.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Tools for maintaining ccode quality and consistency.
- **Radix UI**: A collection of unstyled, accessible UI primitives that allow you to build custom components with full control over styling using Tailwind CSS.

## Configuration Details

### Vite

Vite is used as the build tool for its speed and simplicity. The configuration is available in `vite.config.js`.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is integrated for utility-first styling. The setup includes:

- **Configuation:** `tailwind.config.js`
- **Global Styles:** `src/styles/index.css` (includes directrives for Tailwind's base, components, and utilities)

### React Router

React Router handles routing within the application. Route definitions and configurations are located in the `src/routes/` directory.

### ESLint & Prettier

ESLint and Prettier are cofigured to maintain code quality and consistent formatting:

- **ESLint Configuration:** `.eslintrc.js`
- **Prettier Configuration:** `.prettierrc`

### Radix UI

Radix UI provides headless, accessible components that you can style with Tailwind CSS. This gives you complete control over the appearance while ensuring robust accessibility.

## Future Enhancements

- Expland testing capabilities with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Add more custom hooks and utility functions.
- Integrate a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- ENhanve documentation with examples and usage guides.
