# React Boilerplate

This repository serves as a boilerplate for React projects, providing a clean and scalable starting point using modern tools and best practices. It is designed with Vite for fast development, Tailwind CSS for styling, and React Router for client-side routing.

## Features

- **Vites:** A fast and modern build tool for React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router:** A robust solution for handling client-side routing.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Tools for maintaining ccode quality and consistency.
